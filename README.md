PDF editor application

Uses: 

1) Application can preview uploaded files and re-arrange their page order.
2) Application can merge mulitple pdf files in chosen order.
3) Application can select specific pages for merge.

Dependency management is handled through pip and venv. As the application is simplistic (exclusively uses python) and not a full package, it is best not to over-complicate the versioning of the python libraries.

Warning: No information is stored on the backend, however, one should always be cautious of the files we upload on the internet. I suggest you test it using dummy files.
